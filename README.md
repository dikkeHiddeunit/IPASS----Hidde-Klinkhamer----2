Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
This is a Python implementation of the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows you to play against an AI opponent that uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make intelligent moves.

How to Run the Game
To run the game, you need to execute the GUI file (gui.py). When you run the file, it will prompt you to choose a difficulty level for the AI opponent: easy or hard.

Enter either easy or hard  to select the desired difficulty level. when you have chosen the difficulty level, the GUI window will open, and the game will start automatically.

Gameplay
The game board consists of nine smaller boards arranged in a 3x3 grid. Each smaller board represents a Tic Tac Toe game. The goal is to win three smaller boards in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or to win the entire game by winning three smaller boards in a row.

To make a move, click on one of the available buttons in the active small board. The active small board is determined by the previous move. Once you make a move, the AI opponent will automatically make its move. The game continues until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

AI Difficulty Levels
The AI opponent has two difficulty levels: easy and hard. The difficulty level determines how intelligent the AI is in making moves.

Easy: The AI makes random moves.
Hard: The AI uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make intelligent moves. The higher the difficulty level, the more intelligent and challenging the AI opponent becomes.
Game Over
When the game is over, a message box will appear to display the result. The message box will show whether the player or the AI wins the game or if the game ends in a draw.
